== Binary packages ==

Spek is not yet packaged on many distributions, help in this area will be greatly appreciated.

== Building from the tarball ==

To build Spek, download the source code tarball then run these commands from terminal:

{{{
$ tar -xjvf spek-0.x.tar.bz2
$ cd spek-0.x
$ ./configure
$ make
}}}

To build you will need GTK+ and GStreamer packages, including gst-plugins-base and gst-plugins-good. For MP3 support you need gst-plugins-ugly. On Debian/Ubuntu you also need development packages: libgstreamer0.10-dev and libgtk2.0-dev.

To start Spek, run:

{{{
$ src/spek
}}}

Or install it with:

{{{
$ sudo make install
}}}

== Building from the git repository ==

{{{
$ git clone git://gitorious.org/spek/spek.git spek
$ cd spek
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make
}}}

In addition to the packages listed above, you will need autotools and the Vala compiler (normally packaged as valac).
